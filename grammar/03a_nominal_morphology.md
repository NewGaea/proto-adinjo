Nouns
-----

Every noun in Proto-Adinjo is marked explicitly in the nominative \<**t/tʰ/d**\>, dative \<**ex**\>, or accusative \<**(ʔ)eb**\>. This allows the potential for a free word order, though all modern reconstructions suggest that word order was largely determined by the type of statement being expressed.

```
Gloss           Nominative   Dative    Accusative
woman, person   dont         donux     donub
wolf            ùlkód        ùlkótux   ùlkóʔub
wheel           kúlkot       kúlkwax   kúlkoʔub
```

While every noun in Proto-Adinjo has a gender, their gender seems to be implicit and usually logical (there are some exceptions). For the examples above, a woman is feminine, a wolf is animate or living, and a wheel is inanimate or unliving. There is a manner of agentive promotion, in which a prefix is added to indicate an unusual gender for a given noun. In the lexicon, each noun is defined with its normal (unmarked) gender.

### Nominative ###

The nominative case is used to express the agent or subject of a verb. If the verb is active, the nominative represents an agent, while if the verb is passive the nominative represents a patient. This means that a statement like _dent pèdux_ suggests that the woman is feeding, rather than eating -- she may be feeding another person, someone else may be feeding her, or she may be "disengaged" from the action, as a modern person who eats idly might do. The alternative, _dent pèleduxt_ suggests that she is eating on her own. See the Passive Voice and Active Voice sections below for more details.

The nominative case is marked by replacing the final consonant of the word, and any vowels after it, with the alveolar stop with the same voicing or aspiration as the root form of the word. If the final C(V) segment of a word contains a nasal, the nominative become \<**nt**\>, \<**ntʰ**\> or \<**nd**\>, though it still replaces the following vowels.

### Dative ###

The dative case expresses something which is subject to another force. Typically, it may be used to define something given or exchanged between people, but it is also used to mark vessels and vehicles which are used to transport something between places.
The dative can also express ownership of an object, though more often the genitive particle _kux_ is applied to create a noun phrase in which the owner and owned are both marked with the same case. The genitive particle goes directly between two nouns or noun phrases to combine them into a larger noun phrase. For example:

```
dont        kux   ùlkód      pòdós   módux
woman.NOM   GEN   wolf.NOM   feed    honey.ACC
The woman's wolf is fed honey.
```

Note that _módux_ 'honey' is in the dative -- it is being fed or given to the wolf, which belongs to the woman.

### Accusative ###

The accusative case expresses the recipient of something: the object of a transitive verb, or the patient of an active verb. A passive verb with a nominative and accusative subjects might read like this:

```
dent pèdux èlkóʔeb
The woman feeds the wolf.
```

The woman is passively feeding the wolf. She may be doing so intentionally or unintentionally, which is why she does so passively, but her actions lead to the wolf being fed.

```
dent pèleduxt èlkóʔeb
The woman eats wolf.
```

This, by its active nature, changes the relationship of the words drastically. Once the verb is active, the nominative dent is an agent, and the accusative _ùlkóʔub_ is the thing being eaten.
