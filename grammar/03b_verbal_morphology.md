Verbs
-----

Proto-Adinjo is believed to have had a simple set of paradigms on verbs, with each of the three genders reflected: living (indicated by the infix \<**w**\>), unliving (indicated by the infix \<**ux**\>) and feminine (indicated by the infix \<**et**\>). These infixes attach after the final coda (consonant) of the word, or after the nucleus in the case of words with no coda. The gender of a transitive verb always matches the gender of the object, preferring to match the gender of the dative first, the accusative second, and the nominative only where absolutely necessary.

Gloss                      PAJ               Gender of Object
give birth to a son        dengwe nuzuʔeb    living
give birth to a daughter   dengite bujaʔeb   feminine
eat honey                  pèdux méʃìdeb     unliving
```

In addition to the gender system, verbs inflect for the times of present, near past, and distant past, and for the passive or active voice. Here is the full paradigm of gender, tense, and state for the verb pèd ‘eat’, though it should be noted that the citation forms in the lexicon are genderless, and the gender infixes after the final conjugated consonant:


```
              Distant Past          Near Past             Present
           Passive   Active     Passive   Active     Passive   Active
Unliving   pèduxa    pètoduxa   peduxs    peʔaduxs   pèdux     pèleduxt
Living     pèdóa     pètodóa    pedós     peʔadós    pèdó      pèledót
Feminine   pèdeta    pètodeta   pedets    peʔadets   pèdet     pèleded
```

The distant past generally refers to things more than several days old - modern linguists claim it to mean anywhere from a week to a month past as a starting point. It is created by adding the suffix -a, and made active by adding the infix -to- before the final coda consonant of the root.

The near past refers to the recent past, or events in immediate memory. The passive past is formed by adding the suffix -s to the gender-inflected form. The active form also adds the infix -ʔa- before the final consonant of the root.

The present passive is conjugated only for gender, it is zero-marked for tense. The active form is made with the infix -le- before the final consonant of the root, and the suffix -t at the end of the word. If this results in the cluster {ptk}t, this cluster will dissimilate to the voiced counterpart of the voiceless root consonant {bdg}.
Passive Voice
The passive voice marks the nominative as a subject or patient of a verb. It communicates a lack of agency in the action, even if the nominative subject is active in performing the task. For a clearer view, here are a few uses of the passive voice:
dent pèdux
The woman feeds (a baby, an animal, a man)

Note that the passive voice is always used for nominative unliving objects, as they are seen as never having agency, with the exception of the single unliving noun 
Active Voice
The active voice marks the nominative as a subject or agent of a verb. It communicates agency in the action, even if the agent is passive in performing the task.
