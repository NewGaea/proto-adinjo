This document lists the common words used by the Adin in the time when the Boatmen arrived on Atlantis.

At this point, the language contained the following sounds:

Nasal: m n
Plosive: p b bʰ; t d dʰ; k ɡ ɡʰ; '
Fricative: s; h
Approximant: ɹ; j; w
Lat. Approx.: l

Vowels: i ī; o ō; a ā

The following conventions simplify the above: ɹ is represented as r, and j is represented as y.

The following consonants can serve as a syllable nucleus: m, n, any aspirated consonant, r, l, y, w. \[y\] is equivalent to the sound of /i/ and \[w\] to the otherwise absent sound of /u/
