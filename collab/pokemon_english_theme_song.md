Pokémon Theme Song
==================

English Lyrics
--------------

I want to be the very best<br/>
Like no one ever was.<br/>
To catch them is my real test,<br/>
To train them is my cause.

I will travel across the land,<br/>
Searching far and wide:<br/>
Each Pokémon to understand,<br/>
The power that's inside.

(Pokémon! Got to catch them all)<br/>
It's you and me!<br/>
I know it's my destiny!<br/>
(Pokémon!) Oh!<br/>
You're my best friend,<br/>
In a world we must defend.

(Pokémon! Got to catch them all)<br/>
A heart so true,<br/>
Our courage will pull us through!<br/>
You teach me, and I'll teach you:<br/>
Pokémon! (Got to catch them all)<br/>
Got to catch them all!

Yeah!

Every challenge along the way<br/>
With courage I will face.<br/>
I will battle every day,<br/>
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right:<br/>
There's no better team.<br/>
Arm in arm we'll win the fight,<br/>
It's always been our dream

(Pokémon! Got to catch them all)<br/>
It's you and me<br/>
I know it's my destiny<br/>
(Pokémon!) Oh!<br/>
You're my best friend,<br/>
In a world we must defend.

(Pokémon! Got to catch them all)<br/>
A heart so true,<br/>
Our courage will pull us through!<br/>
You teach me, and I'll teach you:<br/>
Pokemon! (Got to catch them all)

Got to catch them all x5

Yeah!

Pokémon! (Got to catch them all)<br/>
It's you and me<br/>
I know it's my destiny<br/>
Pokémon!<br/>
Oh, you're my best friend,<br/>
In a world we must defend.

(Pokémon! Got to catch them all)<br/>
A heart so true.<br/>
Our courage will pull us through.<br/>
You teach me and I'll teach you.<br/>

Pokémon! (Got to catch them all!!)<br/>
Got to catch them all!!

Pokémon!!!

Lexemes Required to Translate (English)
---------------------------------------

This lists all of the root words necessary to translate this exactly as the
English version presents. To capture the meaning properly in any other language
may require lexemes not listed here, so use this list as a guideline, not a set
of absolute requirements. Use the context in the text to translate by meaning,
not simply word for word.

* **Nouns**: _test, cause, land, power, destiny, friend, world, heart, courage,
  challenge, way, day, place, time, team, arm, fight, dream_
* **Verbs**: _want, be (copula), catch, train, travel, search, understand,
  catch, know, defend, pull, teach, face, battle, claim, come, win_
* **Descriptors**: _best, real, best, true, right (rightful), better_
* **Pronouns**: _I (1S), one, them, it, you, we_
* **Other Words**: _the, very, like, no, ever, across, far, wide, each, inside,
  must (got to), all, and, a, so, through, every, along, with, always_
* **Special Cases**:
  * _**Pokémon**_ is a trademarked term and may be kept as is or translated to
    _LEKATEL_. No attempt should be made to calque _**Pokémon**_ into Adinjo,
    primarily because the work has already been done (_LEKATEL_ is a portmanteau
    of _lekaké_ and _telaru_, meaning "battle beasts").
  * _**Oh!**_ is a vocative, which Adinjo does not explicitly have. This can be
    approximated with the constructions _Ah!_ or _Hai!_, or left as _Oh!_
  * _**Yeah!**_ is a simple interjection in english and may be kept literally,
    adapted phonetically, or adapted to derive from the Adinjo _teçi_ meaning
    "yes."

Translation Status
------------------

**Approved** for translation into all Adin languages.

**Reasoning**: Adinjo is a language connected to **New Gaea** in the **Shattered
Verse**, and New Gaea does include Pokémon, or a very close analog to Pokémon,
based on the legal issues around having actual Pokémon involved. In spite of
this, the modern media around the real world form of Pokémon do exist within
New Gaea, even if the creatures within the world are not _exactly_ Pokémon.

* **Original Adinjo** currently lacks the vocabulary to present this song in
  full.
* **Proto-Adinjo** currently lacks the vocabulary to present this song in full.
