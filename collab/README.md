Adinjo Collaborations
=====================

This directory is for requests (including full text) or text of translations,
suggestions for words (please include IPA, glosses or definitions, and glossed
samples), and other collaborative work involving the Adin languages in any and
all forms.

Translations
------------

You may request a text to be translated (providing a full text in UTF-8, using a
plaintext or Markdown format), or offer a translation for a text that is already
located here. Approved texts will be included in the `/samples` directory of
this project, and will be retained here for translation into other Adinjo forms
as they are developed.

### Requests ###

When requesting a text, please provide a cleanly formatted UTF-8 text using an
English language. You may submit this text in plaintext TXT or plaintext
Markdown. Please do not submit HTML documents or links, and make sure to use one
blank line between each paragraph. You may use section breaks where necessary,
and for any content which includes citation points, enclose the citation numbers
in parentheses. Please refer to the example texts below for examples of cleanly
formatted UTF-8 text:

* **The Babel Text** (Genesis 10:1-12, King James Version)
* **Schleicher's Fable**
* **The North Wind and the Sun**
* **The Donkey Beater**
* **The Gift of the Spirits** (Adin Creation Myth)

### Submissions ###

Submissions should provide, as best possible, an interlinear gloss of the text
as well as a cleanly-formatted version of the Adinjo and re-translated text.
