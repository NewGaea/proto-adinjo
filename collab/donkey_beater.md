The Donkey Beater Fable
=======================

There was once a man who beat his donkey every day. One day, a second man, who
was a neighbor, came to the donkey-beater and asked, "Why do you beat your
donkey?" The donkey-beater said, "Beating is all the donkey knows, I must beat
him until he learns how to behave."

The donkey-beater then went into his home and discovered his dinner wasn’t
ready, so he beat his wife. His neighbor heard the screams of the
donkey-beater’s wife and came to the door. "You should not beat your wife so
much," said the neighbor. "I beat her until she learns to have dinner ready on
time."

Some time later, the neighbor saw the donkey-beater beating his son in a field.
This time, he did not say anything, but seized the donkey-beater and began to
beat him with a heavy cudgel. When the donkey-beater asked why his neighbor was
beating him, his neighbor replied, "I will beat you until you learn not to beat
others."

Lexemes Required to Translate (English)
---------------------------------------

This lists all of the root words necessary to translate this exactly as the
English version presents. To capture the meaning properly in any other language
may require lexemes not listed here, so use this list as a guideline, not a set
of absolute requirements. Use the context in the text to translate by meaning,
not simply word for word.

* **Nouns**: _man, donkey, day, neighbor, beater, home, dinner, wife, scream,
  door, time, son, field, thing, cudgel_
* **Verbs**: _is (copula), beat, come, ask, say, do, know, learn, behave, go,
  discover, hear, scream, have, seized, begin, reply_
* **Descriptors**: _one (once), every, second, all, ready, much, heavy_
* **Pronouns**: _there, he (his), one, who, why, you, I, how, then, she (her),
  this, some, when, other_
* **Other Words**: _a, the, to, and, until, into, not, should, so, to (inf),
  later_
* **Special Cases**: _donkey-beater_ requires _donkey_ and _beat_, along with a
  set of rules to compound and to form "a person who beats," whether it can be
  used unbound to make _beater_, or only bound to an object of beating.

Translation Status
------------------

**Approved** for translation into all Adin languages.

* **Original Adinjo** currently lacks the vocabulary to present this story in
  full.
  * Of note, while Original Adinjo lacks the word _beat_, it does have the
    derivation rule necessary to form _beater_ once _beat_ does exist. The
    suffix _-tax_ means "one who does verb," and while it is widely used for
    professionals, it can be used for any person who does an action.
* **Proto-Adinjo** currently lacks the vocabulary to present this story in full.

Context
-------

This fable was created by George Corley of the Conlangery podcast in [Episode 35: _Practicum - Getting Rid of Case Marking_](http://conlangery.com/2012/01/30/conlangery-35-practicum-getting-rid-of-case-marking/).

The purpose is a story which can be used to translate texts in languages without
the feature of _case marking_, which is common in many natural and constructed
languages. In spite of this, the fable of the **donkey-beater** is a useful tool
for translations of all sorts, as it is freely available online.
