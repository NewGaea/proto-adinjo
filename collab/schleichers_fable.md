The Sheep and the Horses
========================

English Text
------------

[On a hill,] a sheep that had no wool saw horses, one of them pulling a heavy
wagon, one carrying a big load, and one carrying a man quickly. The sheep said
to the horses: "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving horses." The horses
said: "Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master,
makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has
no wool." Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.

Commentary
----------

This is a cleanly formatted sample text using UTF-8 encoded English. Note that
the lines all terminate at 80 characters or less -- while this is not required,
it is strongly recommended. CommonMark, at the least, will process the newline
token as a space, so terminating lines early poses no challenge to clean texts
for Kharon, provided that lines always terminate between words. This text only
demonstrates a single paragraph.

An 80-character horizontal rule using - is included for measuring line length,
if you use an editor whcih does not count character position within lines.
